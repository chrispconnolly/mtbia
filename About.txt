\nMTBI Assist is a mobile application to help manage the symptoms of MTBI or Mild Traumatic Brain Injury (also known as concussion).  To begin, touch or slide Menu in the upper left corner of the screen.\n\nI developed this application to help concussion sufferers after experiecing a concussion of my own.  MTBI Assist is based in part on the Acute Concussion Evaluation checklist established by the Centers for Disease control (http://www.cdc.gov/headsup/pdfs/providers/ace-a.pdf).  I found the CDC resources to be extremely beneficial and thought that a mobile application using their rubric could greatly help patients track and manage their symptoms following a concussion, MTBI or during Post Concussive Syndrom.\n\nMTBI in no way provides diagnostic support, treatment recommendations and provides no warranties or garauntees.  MTBI Assist\'s sole purpose is to allow injry sufferers to track and monitor their symptoms and/or to use this information along with a physician to identify the best treatment options.  MTBI Assist is available free of charge under the xxx license.  MTBI Assist leverages the hellocharts-android framework for its charting capabilities.\n\n<b>Enter Symptoms:</b> To enter your symptoms, first select a date for the symptoms.  Then select your symptoms for this date under each of the headings: Physical, Cognitive, Emotional and Sleep.\n\n<b>Track Symptoms:</b> You can track your symptoms using either a Chart or Table format.\n\n<b>Daily Alerts:</b> You set daily alerts, or reminders, to ensure you enter your symptoms in daily.\n\n<b>Email Symptoms:</b> You can email your symptoms to yourself or a healthcare provider using an email account already setup on your device.\n\n<b>Top Navigation:</b> You can access most parts of the application using the icons at the top of the application.
